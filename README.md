# UI - Accessibility

## I did a form in another project "Javascript-in-the-browser-forms" So i decided to use the same form and redo the project.
## After i pushed it live and tested it in a Wave Tool site called https://wave.webaim.org/
## I got 3 errors from the first check, after I got the error feedback I fixed what was wrong and ended up with 0 errors so my site should be accessible.
## UI accessibility is something that designers and developers need to think about in every site created. I used the aria-label on my input fields so text to speech apps should read what the fields are saying.
